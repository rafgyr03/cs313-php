     <p>
       This website will contain links to the different assignments that I will do
       this semester for CS313. Currently, there is none; but that will change soon.
       There will also be a project for this semester; a link to it will appear
       here in the home page when the project is started.

     <h2 class="assign">About Me</h2>
     <p>Hello!<p/>
     <p>
       I am Rafael Hernandez Rivera and I am from Monterrey, Mexico.
       I am studying Computer Engineering, but I do like web development. Although
       I prefer to do the part where you solve problems with code rather than doing
       pretty stuff with it.
